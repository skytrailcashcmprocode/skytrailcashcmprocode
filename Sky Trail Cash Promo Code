Payday loans: If you just need a small amount of cash, a payday loan gives you an advance on your paycheck. The downside is that these short-term loans have a high fee, but you wonâ€™t have to repay them over a long period of time like other loans since they are typically due within a short timeframe.
Title loans: Another short-term loan option, a title loan is a secured loan that uses a car title as collateral. This could be an accessible emergency loan for people with bad credit, but these loans have very high APRs.
Credit card cash advances: Most credit cards allow you to borrow cash from your line of credit, but you'll typically pay a higher cash advance APR and have no grace period. There is also an upfront fee added, typically around 3% to 5% of the amount borrowed.
