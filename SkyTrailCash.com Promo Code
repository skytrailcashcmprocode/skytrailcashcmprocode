 Emergency loans are a type of personal loan for people who find themselves in an unexpected situation and need cash fast. In general, they provide a lump sum of cash, and then borrowers pay off the loan at a fixed interest rate for a specific term.

Banks, credit unions, and online lenders may offer emergency loans. Eligibility and the cost to you will depend on creditworthiness, and there are even specific emergency loans for bad credit borrowers. Typically, emergency loans have a lower maximum loan amount than some other types of lending products.
