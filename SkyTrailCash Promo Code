When deciding if an emergency loan is best for you, start by checking your credit score. You can then search for lenders and try pre-qualifying with one or two lenders to see if youâ€™d meet their basic requirements for approval and get a sense of the interest rate you would receive. From there, you could use a personal loan calculator to see what your monthly and overall borrowing costs would be for different term lengths. 

To get an emergency loan, the process is similar to other types of loans. First, you must complete an application, sharing your personal contact information, providing documentation about your income, and stating how much you are hoping to borrow. The lender will review your application and may ask for permission to review your credit.
